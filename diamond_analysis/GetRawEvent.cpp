 /*******************************Raw Event Routine**********************************/

/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As arguements, Eventread_final takes in the Run name in the form "RUN_100XY" and the integer number of data files 
in the entire run.

The Event read in routine is a root program that takes the raw binary data from the October 2006 CERN Test Beam run,
reads it in, and then sorts the bits into various sized variables as described by the Event structure which is listed
in the Diamondstruct.h header file. Each data file contains up to 10000 events where each event has header and trailer
data and ADC values for 4 silicon detectors (the reference telescope) and a diamond detector. An issue with the raw data
is that it was originally written using one type of endianness, but is being read in and analyzed by a computer that the
opposite endianess. Thus, after reading in the bits, the byte order is swapped before being read out as a data value. 
A number of endian swap routines are listed before the main program for various data types. The silicon ADC values are 
only one byte in size and do not need to be endian swapped. Anything larger than one byte however is swapped. The data
values are then sorted and stored into arrays depending on which detector or layer (X or Y) they correspond to. The original
DAQ readme listed the order in which the 2048 bytes were read in. Once sorted, the arrays are stored as branches on a TTree 
and then written to a root file. This root file is then opened by other programs including Eventanalyze which displays
the ADC values on an event by event basis. 

Note on Variable names: The 4 silicon detectors have 2 layers each and are listed as detectors 0 through 4 and layers
X and Y. Thus the first detector, X layer is D0X and so on. The diamond detector is ususally referred to as Dia or Diamond.
